## Sir Kevin the Crisp

This is a multipurpose discord bot designed to be used with minimal load in small, private servers. There is currently no implementation for dealing with multiple chat requests or differentiating between servers. You will need your own discord bot and OpenAI access in order to set it up on your personal servers.

To get it operable, learn how to add a discord bot to a server, giving it full access to intents and scopes. Then copy the discord bot token and replace "token" in Kevin.cs with your token. You will also need to replace the "TOKEN" string in GPTHandler.cs with your OpenAI client in order to connect to ChatGPT.

That should be it. From there, you can adjust default prompt, give the bot a different name, etc. You will need to either run the bot on a server or keep your computer online permanently in order to get it to respond to user requests. 

Perhaps I should do more with this project, but I'm too lazy.

Off to other projects.
